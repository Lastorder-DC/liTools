Support for new IDs and filenames in pakfiles:
	-- small sndmanifest.dat in each mod where there are new sound files?
	-- modManage support for these new files - spec for what files go in what pakfiles?
Split itemmanifest.dat.xml stuff into separate files -- think of good way to merge new stuff in
Add security features to prevent any old executable or potential virus from being inside a .pak file
Add security (and bug-prevention) features to prevent any file outside of vdata/ or data/ from being compressed/decompressed
myPicturesImage.dat, smokeImage.dat, & fluidPalettes.dat compression/decompression

Support for .flac.ogg in filelists instead of .flac and stuff? (See README line 102)
XML specification instead of .filelist.txt for mod creation?
Work with puggsoy/others for GUI ease of use
