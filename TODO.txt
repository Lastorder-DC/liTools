* 12/19/12 * Merging capability so new mods can be added without the lengthy decompress/decompress/compress method
	- XML specification instead of .filelist.txt for mod creation?
	- XML specification for which files go in which pakfiles?
	- Some kind of backup capability so that mods can be uninstalled easily
XML specification for vdata/wordPackDict.dat with compression/decompression routines
Automatic updating of vdata/sndmanifest.dat when .ogg files are modified
	- XML specification for takes, so that those can be modified as well?	
GUI for ease of use


Done
* 12/18/12 * Multithreading for faster compression/decompression
