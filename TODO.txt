Support for new IDs and filenames in pakfiles:
	-- small sndmanifest.dat in each mod where there are new sound files?
	-- modManage support for these new files - spec for what files go in what pakfiles?
Think of good way to merge new stuff into XML files
Add security features to prevent any old executable or potential virus from being inside a .pak file
Add security (and bug-prevention) features to prevent any file outside of vdata/ or data/ from being compressed/decompressed

Support for .flac.ogg in filelists instead of .flac and stuff? (See README line 102)
XML specification instead of .filelist.txt for mod creation?
Work with puggsoy/others for GUI ease of use
